I've had this idea for some time and never allocated some time to play around with it. I was on a flight on my way from Budapest when I quickly put together some code for this.

I'm building a form that asks people who are a part of the software industry in Iceland what they think about various things.
I will use these answers to test out charts.js and build some charts, graphs and cool things.

Of course anyone can answer these questions, I could try to make it so that only people in Iceland could answer it, but I trust the people are honest and when mark that they are not a part of the Icelandic software developer industry.

I made an easy mockup in excalidraw on how I visualized this thing.

I started to build a quick draft of the mockup. I hade some simple dummy data to work with.

I used the `react-hook-forms` package to build the form. I've used it before and it's really easy to use and get started with.

Here is a simple form to show how easy it works!

tip: I recommend to use the `watch` method while getting comfortable with the package. It's really easy to use and you can get the values of the form in real time.
