I would say that I'm above average curious person. I find everything interesting in it's own way.
I'm also the biggest supporter of people. The life is **not** a zero-sum game. So I hope that everyone does the best they can do.

I'm building a form that asks people who are a part of the software industry in Iceland what they think about various things.
I will use these answers to test out charts.js and build some charts, graphs and cool things.

Of course anyone can answer these questions, I could try to make it so that only people in Iceland could answer it, but I trust the people are honest and when mark that they are not a part of the Icelandic software developer industry.

I've had this idea for some time and never allocated some time to play around with it. I was on a flight on my way from Budapest when I quickly put together some code for this.

I made an easy mockup in excalidraw on how I visualized this thing.

I started to build a quick draft of the mockup. I hade some simple dummy data to work with.
