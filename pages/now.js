            is live in Copenhagen. So if you're company is in the need of a delicious and various
            lunch and you are in the vicinity of Vesterbro reach out. ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ I've been spending the
            last couple of weeks working on our internal tools. Retool works great for that, it
            allows us to iterate quickly. It was almost a surprise how important it is to have good
            reliable internal tools. It's a lot of fun to work on them and see how much they help
            the company.

            It's built in TypeScript, React, chakra-ui and react-query. I'm working on the frontend
            part of the project. They do also have an app built in Flutter. I don't have any
            experience with Flutter, but it would be fun to get experience and learn something new.

            I've been building a Procurement system for them. It has been up and down but it's
            getting better and better. It always surprise me a bit the scope of projects. It's easy
            to overlook a part of it and for it to grow. I think it matters a lot to have the scope
            as well defined as you can!

            I'm not very experienced at writing in TypeScript but, I want to improve so this is a
            grate opportunity to get better. The guys who build the gigOver site did a good job and
            I hope that I'm not ruining the codebase too much with my sloppy TS code ðŸ˜¬.

          It's not the best system in the world but it helps me a lot to keep control over the
          things I want to do. I recommend that you read it and try out Obsidian to make your own
          system.
